# Currency-Converter-App
This is my second Project of Currency Converting Calculator Built using HTML,CSS and Javascript

A Currency Converter project is a tool or application that allows users to convert an amount of one currency into another based on real-time exchange rates. The core of the project involves:

Input: Users provide the amount they wish to convert and select the source and target currencies.

Exchange Rate Retrieval: The system fetches live exchange rates from an API (such as Open Exchange Rates, CurrencyLayer, or a similar service)

Calculation: The project multiplies the input amount by the exchange rate to calculate the equivalent amount in the target currency.

Output: The converted amount is displayed to the user.

Additional features might include:

A historical exchange rate viewer.

Support for multiple currencies.

A user-friendly interface.

The project could be implemented as a web application, mobile app, or even a command-line tool depending on the requirements.
